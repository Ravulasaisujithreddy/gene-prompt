Genie Prompt
Genie Prompt is an AI-powered chat interface designed to showcase frontend skills, creative data handling, and dynamic interaction capabilities. The app allows users to submit prompts and interact with AI models either directly or through a two-step process for improved responses.

Features
AI Chat Interface: Engage directly with an AI model by sending user-inputted prompts.
Prompt Generation: Submit a query as a question to generate a refined prompt and use this to get a more comprehensive response.
Dynamic Display: Formatted text rendering using the npm markdown package to ensure a clean, professional user interface.
Frontend Showcase: Demonstrates creativity, responsiveness, and data handling in a modern web application.
How It Works
User Prompt: Enter a query or command into the input field.
Direct Submission: Send the input directly to the AI model for an immediate response.
Prompt Refinement: Alternatively, submit the input as a question to generate a more polished prompt. Use this refined prompt to get a more precise or detailed response.
Formatted Output: Responses are displayed using markdown for enhanced readability.
